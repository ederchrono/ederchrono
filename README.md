### Hi! I'm Eder DÃ­az

I have over 11 years of experience in frontend development, primarily in media and entertainment industries. 

I'm passionate about making highly interactive sites and apps. 

Additionally, I love teaching about refactoring and UI programatic animations. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing and making video games, brewing beer and traveling.
